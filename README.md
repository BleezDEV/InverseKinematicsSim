# Inverse Kinematics Simulator - with 2 Robot Arms
Simple robot arm simulator that implements my own custom inverse kinematics algorithm to determine angles of two robot arm joints in order to move an end effector to a desired point. The desired point is defined by user cursor movement.

(I will add detailed diagrams and explanations of how code works here)
